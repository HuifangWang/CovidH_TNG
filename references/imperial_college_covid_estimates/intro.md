# Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 14 European countries

## Content of this website

For the COVID-19 epidemics in several European countries, estimates of

- the number of infections and
- the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

## Key assumptions/model properties

- We use a Bayesian model that calculates backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior.
- Changes in the reproductive number â€“ a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to interventions.
- Each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number across countries and over time, excluding the lockdown intervention. For lockdown, we now estimate a global effect and a country specific effect.
- The interventions that we consider have different implementation details across countries, which we do not take into account.
- We make various further assumptions that our model results are contingent on (e.g. about the time between infections, about being able to observe all COVID-related deaths, about the time between infection and death and about the infection-fatality-ratio).
